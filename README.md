# uno-ai

This is my first foray into multi-agent RL. The idea is to train an AI to play the game Uno, by continually running it against earlier versions of itself.

So far I have implemented the game dynamics and a multi-agent training setup. I'm running training now, and will report on my results. Chances are there's at least one bug lurking around somewhere.
